 * - set interrupts used both preemption and to handle sleeping threads wakeup

 * Please note that all functions in this interface should provide the kernel
 * with time information in nanoseconds. In the platform-specific implementation
 * it is highly recommended to use the TimeConversion class to convert the

 * 
 * NOTE: when porting Miosix, architectures providing
 * - a timer counting up
 * - a match register capable of generating interrupts
 * - an overflow interrupt
 * can simply derive the TimerAdapter providing the required functions to
 * access the hardware timer, and the DEFAULT_OS_TIMER_INTERFACE_IMPLMENTATION

        // one. The basic idea is this: the lower bits of the 64bit timer are
        // kept by the counter register of the timer, while the upper bits are
        // kept in a software variable. When the hardware timer overflows, an
        // interrupt is used to update the upper bits.
        // Reading the timer may appear to be doable by just an OR operation
        // between the software variable and the hardware counter, but is
        // actually way trickier than it seems, because user code may:
        // 1 disable interrupts,
        // 2 spend a little time with interrupts disabled,
        // 3 call this function.
        // Now, if a timer overflow occurs while interrupts are disabled, the
        // upper bits have not yet been updated by the overflow interrupt, so
        // we would return the wrong time.
        // To fix this, we check the timer overflow pending bit, and if it is
        // set we return the time adjusted accordingly. This almost works, the
        // last issue to fix is that reading the timer counter and the pending
        // bit is not an atomic operation, and the counter may roll over exactly
        // at that point in time. In this case we must not increment the upper
        // bits at all. To solve this, we read the timer a second time to see if
        // it had rolled over.
        // This is the pending bit trick, that in a nutshell uses the overflow
        // pending flag as an extra timer bit, and accounts for the
        // impossibility to atomically read the timer counter and pending flag.
