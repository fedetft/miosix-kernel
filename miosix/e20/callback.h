/**
 * A Callback works just like an std::function, but has some additional
 * <b>limitations</b>. First, it can only accept function objects that take void
 * as a parameter and return void, and second if the size of the
 * implementation-defined type returned by bind is larger than N a
 * compile-time error is generated. Also, calling an empty Callback does
 * nothing, while doing the same on a function results in an exception
 * being thrown.
 * 
 * The reason why one would want to use this class is because, other than the
 * limitations, this class also offers a guarantee: it will never allocate
 * data on the heap. It is not just a matter of code speed: in Miosix calling
 * new/delete/malloc/free from an interrupt routine produces undefined
 * behaviour, so this class enables binding function calls form an interrupt
 * safely.
 * 
 * \param N the size in bytes that an instance of this class reserves to
 * store the function objects. If the line starting with 'typedef char check1'
 * starts failing it means it is time to increase this number. The size
 * of an instance of this object is N+sizeof(void (*)()), but with N rounded
 * by excess to four byte boundaries.
