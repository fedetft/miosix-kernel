/*
 * This linker script puts:

 * - stacks, heap and sections .data and .bss in the internal ram
 * - the external ram (if available) is not used.

/*
 * The main stack is used for interrupt handling by the kernel.
 *
 * *** Readme ***
 * This linker script places the main stack (used by the kernel for interrupts)
 * at the bottom of the ram, instead of the top. This is done for two reasons:
 *
 * - as an optimization for microcontrollers with little ram memory. In fact
 *   the implementation of malloc from newlib requests memory to the OS in 4KB
 *   block (except the first block that can be smaller). This is probably done
 *   for compatibility with OSes with an MMU and paged memory. To see why this
 *   is bad, consider a microcontroller with 8KB of ram: when malloc finishes
 *   up the first 4KB it will call _sbrk_r asking for a 4KB block, but this will
 *   fail because the top part of the ram is used by the main stack. As a
 *   result, the top part of the memory will not be used by malloc, even if
 *   available (and it is nearly *half* the ram on an 8KB mcu). By placing the
 *   main stack at the bottom of the ram, the upper 4KB block will be entirely
 *   free and available as heap space.
 *
 * - In case of main stack overflow the cpu will fault because access to memory
 *   before the beginning of the ram faults. Instead with the default stack
 *   placement the main stack will silently collide with the heap.
 * Note: if increasing the main stack size also increase the ORIGIN value in
 * the MEMORY definitions below accordingly.
