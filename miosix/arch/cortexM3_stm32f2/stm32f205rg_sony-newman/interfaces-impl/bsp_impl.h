     * microcontroller and its peripherals, minus the RTC. Power gating is not
     * applied, so the CPU registers, RAM and peripheral contents are preserved.
     * The current consumption goes down to 300uA, and with the 110mAh battery
     * in the sony watch, it would last 366 hours in this state. The packaging
     * of the watch says that the standby time is 330 hours, so this is clearly
     * how they did it.
     * 
     * There are a few words of warning for using this mode, though
     * - Entering/exiting deep sleep may take a significant time, so the sleep
     *   time may not be precise down to the last millisecond.
     * - You have to turn off all other stuff external to the microcontroller
     *   that draw power to actually reduce the consumption to 300uA. If you
     *   leave the display ON, or the accelerometer, the consumption will be
     *   higher. The Driver for the battery voltage measurement and light sensor
     *   already turn off the enable pin so don't worry.
     * - If you are designing a multithreaded application, you have to make
     *   sure all your threads are in an interruptible point. For example, if
     *   you call this function while a thread is transfering data through I2C,
     *   it may cause problems.
     * - Also, the BSP needs to be optimized for low power, and this is a TODO.
     *   Even leaving a single GPIO floating can significantly increase the
     *   power consumption. Normally, I would do that using a multimeter to
     *   measure current and an oscilloscope to probe around, but I don't want
     *   to open my watch, and there is no schematic, which makes things harder.
     *   For this reason, I can't guarantee that the current will be as low as
     *   300uA.
     * - Also, for now I've implemented only timed wakeup. What will be
     *   interesting is to also have event wakeup. For example, wake up on
     *   accelerometer tapping detected, or on RTC alarms that can be set at a
     *   given date and time.
