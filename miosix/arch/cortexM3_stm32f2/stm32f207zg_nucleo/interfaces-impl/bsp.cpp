This function disables filesystem (if enabled), serial port (if enabled) and
puts the processor in deep sleep mode.<br>
Wakeup occurs when PA.0 goes high, but instead of sleep(), a new boot happens.
<br>This function does not return.<br>
WARNING: close all files before using this function, since it unmounts the
filesystem.<br>
When in shutdown mode, power consumption of the miosix board is reduced to ~
5uA??, however, true power consumption depends on what is connected to the GPIO
pins. The user is responsible to put the devices connected to the GPIO pin in the
minimal power consumption mode before calling shutdown(). Please note that to
minimize power consumption all unused GPIO must not be left floating.
