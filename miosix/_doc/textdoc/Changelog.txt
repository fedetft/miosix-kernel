Changelog for Miosix np embedded OS

v2.02
- Found a long-standing undefined behaviour in Thread::sleep() and
  Thread::sleepUntil() where the variable "SleepData d" was used beyond its
  scope. The issue was found by code inspection, and by disassembling the code
  it was found that the assembly code was correct despite the undefined
  behaviour in the source code. This is why the issue has remained unidentified
  for so long, as it caused no bug to occur.
- Reworked timeconversion.h and timeconversion.cpp with much improved
  algorithms for converting from timer ticks to nanoseconds and back
- Modified the policy about global objects inside the kernel. The previous
  policy was to forbid them, by checking with a script that there were none.
  This policy was found to be too restrictive, so a new script
  (miosix/_tools/kernel_global_objects.pl) moves the pointers to function that
  cause their construction in a separate section compared to the one used for
  the application global objects. Thus the global objects are now divided in
  two group: the kernel ones, which are called before boot, and the application
  ones, which are called after boot, right before main. This is made necessary
  by the fact that Miosix allows an application to be statically linked with the
  kernel, so both end up in the same binary file.
- Added SoftwareI2C::sendRepeatedStart(), and fixed a glitch in
  SoftwareI2C::init()
- Fixed bug in STM32Serial in IOCTL_SYNC
- Added test to testsuite to explicitly check the tickSkew logic
- Fixed two bugs in kernel.cpp related to the control scheduler. 1. The idle
  thread needs to be set after the main one. 2. The yield on tick skew in
  restartKernel() was not functioning after the code was rewritten using atomic
  operations. The control scheduler heavily relies on this, because if the burst
  of the current thread finishes while the kernel is paused, preemption can only
  occur here, as the control scheduler does not perform periodic preemption.
- Added skyward's anakin board

v2.01
- Renamed board codenamed "polinode" to its final name "wandstem"
- Committed patch from Alain <carpikemail@gmail.com> to make build output more
  readable. Detailed compiler options are still available building with
  "make VERBOSE=1"
- Fixed bug in intrusive.h which caused compiler errors when building with
  exceptions and RTTI disabled
- Added new board: stm32f411re_nucleo
- Added timeconversion.cpp/.h as the first step towards high resolution
  timers
- Added new board: efm32gg332f1024_polinode
- Added new architacture: cortexM3_efm32gg
- Refactored endianness and atomic_ops interfaces from the individual
  architectures to arch/common/core to prevent code duplication.
- Added preliminary C++11 support
v2.0
- Added support for new board, oledboard2
- Added support for new board, tempsensor
- Added support for new board als_mainboard_rev2
- Be less restrictive in pthread_attr_setstacksize(). Accept also stack sizes
  not divisible by 4, as Thread::create() will simply align the stack size.
- Added proper compiler patch versioning through the _MIOSIX_GCC_PATCH_VERSION
  builtin macro.
- Added small fixed to the previous newlib patch. This is the final change for
  termios.h
- Implemented termios support in Miosix, now it is possible to disable echo
  and/or enter raw mode on serial ports using a standard POSIX interface.
- Added sys/termios.h to newlib patch
- Added sys/ioctl.h to newlib patch
- Improved Makefile path referencing to always use relative paths, as using
  absolute ones fails when the absolute path contains spaces. This proved to
  be impossible with makefiles alone and required to add a small perl script
- Added versioning to miosix_settings.h and board_settings.h to prevent
  misconfiguration when those files are updated.
- Moved board_settings.h in the config directory to allow out of git tree
  projects to tweak those files without editing files in the Miosix git repo.
- Added miosix/_tools/init_project_out_of_git_tree.pl script to help set up
  out of git tree projects.
- New makefile now supporting out of git tree projects, to help having the
  Miosix git repo as a submodule of another git repo.
- Updated backend_benchmark.cpp to use DevFs instead of the old Disk interface.
- Fixed a bug in the stm32 SDIO drivers that caused the slowest clock speed
  selection, resulting in a serious performance regression when writing to
  an SD card. Bug was added in commit e697ded4325a5a2de12706712abc4a846d733b3e
- Added streamwriter example to show how to write to an SD card at a relatively
  high data rate.
- Added dirlist testcase
- Relaxed file open mode checks in DevFs to allow opening device files with
  fopen()
- Added loop mount example.
- Fixed a bug in umount().
- Reworked logging.h to decrease code size.
- Moving from mallinfo() to _mallinfo_r() in getCurrentFreeHeap() to avoid
  accidentally bringing in iprintf(), which increases code size.
- Added RCC_SYNC() macro to all stm32 BSPs to workaround an errata in the
  stm32f42x requiring additional cycles to enable clock gating. From now on
  it is suggested to add an RCC_SYNC() after every access to the RCC to
  enable clock gating an all stm32 ports.
- Added SDRAM initialization code for stm32f429 board, and SDRAM linker
  scripts. The new default is to put .data/.bss/stack and heap in the SDRAM,
  and to leave the upper 2MB of it for the LCD.
- Cleaned up code completion configuration for Netbeans. Now the IDE
  automatically detects the source files that belong to the project by looking 
  at the debug symbols in the produced elf file. 
- Added memory barrier to saveContext() to prevent a race condition found in
  the new stm32f429 board.
- Now Makefile.inc has no predefined board. This has been done in order to
  avoid mistakenly compiling for the wrong board.
- Fixed bug in testsuite: it failed compiling with exceptions disabled due
  to RTTI dependence.
- Fixed a bug in Thread::create() causing a crash when the heap is full.
- Changed PROGRAM_CMDLINE for stm32vldiscovery from vsprog to stm32flash
- Unified the CMSIS directories in the various subdirectories of arch into
  one CMSIS, in order to reduce the amount of code duplication and to avoid
  having to deal with subtle incompatibilities between different CMSIS versions
- Added support for stm32f2xx and specifically the new stm32f4discovery with
  an LCD display.
- After so many changes and improvements, officially releasing Miosix 2.0beta1
v2.0beta1
- Upgraded compiler build scripts to build a redistributable Miosix Toolchain
  for both Linux and Windows
- Changed makefile: moved from bash for loops to GNU Make for loops to avoid
  a bash dependence that makes it difficult to build Miosix under windows
- Added servomotor driving library for stm32f4discovery and stm32vldiscovery
- Modified BSPs to instantiate the new classes
- Changed basicFilesystemSetup() to take a pointer to a device to mount as /sd
- Added SD drivers for stm32 and lpc2000 to miosix/common/drivers, adapted to
  the Device interface
- Fixed bug in the testsuite that was causing a file to be opened for reading
  while another thread still had it opened for writing.
- Removed interfaces/disk.h
- Starting to remove disk interface. Aggregated stm32f2 and stm32f4 drivers
  into one.
- Breaking change; the default serial for the stm32f4discovery is now USART3
  Please connect to PB10 and PB11 instead of PA2 and PA3.
- Completed serial new serial port driver, added DMA support for USART2 and 3
- Added -f option to rm in Makefile and miosix/Makefile, so that when
  doing make clean on an already clean directory, no errors are reported
- Added DMA RX for USART1 un STM32Serial. Also fixed bugs on stm32f1.
- Fixed a bug in STM32Serial: the position of the PPRE1 and PPRE2 bitfields
  in RCC->CFGR varies from device family. This was causing incorrect baudrate
  settings in some configurations.
- Added support for RTS/CTS hardware flow control to STM32 serial ports
- Added class DynUnsyncQueue to kernel/queue.h, a new circular buffer with its
  storage heap allocated.
- Breaking change: refactored the interface of class BufferQueue, and removed
  its header file. Added header kernel/queue.h with all the varius FIFO data
  structures in the kernel.
- Breaking change: serial port drivers used to have a read function to read
  a buffer of data that would return a buffer with exactly the asked size
  of data. Now they return up to that size, but if an idle line is found
  they may return less. This change is exploited in the TerminalDevice class
  to read data a buffer at a time, and not one character at a time, so all
  serial driver must implement this behaviour, or reading from serial port
  won't work as expected. Both STM32 and LPC2000 driver have been upgraded.
- bootlog() and errorLog() now support format strings.
- Unified stm32f1 and stm32f2,f4,l1 serial port drivers. Now the
  driver for USART1 is DMA based also on the stm32f2 and f4.
- Fixed makefile dependencies to allow Miosix parallel builds with
  make -j4, make -j8, ... to speed up compilation on multicores.
- Restored support for DCC. It broke somewhere when transitioning to the
  new Device-based serial port drivers. Removed DCC support on stm32f4 as,
  due to OpenOCD limitations, it never actually worked.
- Removed the console interface (file interfaces/console.h).
- Factorized common code in the various stm32 serial port drivers. Work
  is still ongoing, as stm32f1 still has a different driver, and since
  DMA mode needs to be implemented.
- Fixed a null pointer dereference in Queue class.
- Fixed compiling kernel without WITH_FILESYSTEM
- Added class LPC2000Serial. The lpc2000 port no longer relies on
  the Console interface.
- Class TerminalDevice is no longer a proxy for a FileBase, but an adapter
  that allows to wrap a serial port, which has a Device interface into a
  FileBase interface.
- Removed class ConsoleDevice. The purpose of its interface is now carried
  out by the Device class of DevFs. This will allow to list serial ports
  among the devices of DevFs, and additionally results in code size reduction.
- Factorized common code in the various interrupts.h and interrupts.cpp from
  the various arch directories to miosix/common. Now all cortex bsps use the
  same code for handling fault interrupts, avoiding code duplication.
- Added forwarding of file mode in the open() syscall.
- Implemented may other syscalls.
- Rewritten syscall handling for processes. Fixed many vulnerabilites in the
  checking of syscall parameters.
- Fixed MPU size calculation, added _elf_pool_start and _elf_pool_end symbols
  that a linker script supporting processes must provide.
- Thread creation no longer calls errorHandler(OUT_OF_MEMORY) if there
  is no memory to create a thread. This has been done to prevent system
  reboots when the (kernel) heap is full, especially if a process creates
  another process.
- Refactored Thread::createUserspace() to call Thread::doCreate()
- Added a per-process FileDescriptorTable
- Added ProcessBase class. The kernel used to have a null pointer as process,
  now it has a ProcessBase instance, and is the only entity that has an
  instance of PRocessBase that is not also an instance of Process.
- Merged processes branch
- breaking change: updated newlib patch to make off_t a 64bit type. This allows
  accessing files larger than 4GByte for filesystems that support it (currently,
  only DevFs). This change requires recompiling GCC!
- Changed Fat32Fs so that reads and writes are directed to a generic file
  instead of to the disk interface. Added temporary DiskAdapter class to
  maintain compatibility with the old interface until bsps are upgraded.
- Major rework and simplification of the DevFs infrastructure. Getting rid of
  stateless device files. All devices are now stateful, and to make a device you
  only have to subclass Device and implement readBlock()/writeBlock()/ioctl()
- Removed sync() syscall, replaced by ioctl()
- Added ioctl() syscall, and miosix/filesystem/ioctl.h with list of IOCTLs
- Removed reliance on global variable for FatFs, to have allow mounting more
  than one independent Fat32 filesystem.
- First working but inefficient unicode support for fat32
- Fixed a bug in fat32 directory listing causing file names to be skipped when
  listing large directories.
- Added basic unicode helper functions
- Implemented inode support in FAT32
- Started implementing FAT32 directory listing, still needs work.
- Implemented getcwd() and chdir() syscalls
- Added assertion check that openFileCount is always positive
- newFileOpened() is now called in FileBase constructor if parent is not null,
  so filesystems need not remember to do that
- Updated newlib patch to fix an use after free in closedir()
  This change requires recompiling GCC!
- Updated newlib patch for consistency with upstream change.
  Updated gcc patch for better buffer usage.
  This change requires recompiling GCC!
- Performance improved SD driver ported to all stm32 targets
- Updated newlib compiler patches to improve write performance also for
  fully buffered files. This change and the previous one require
  recompiling GCC
- Updated from GCC 4.7.2 to GCC 4.7.3, due to reported problems building
  the previous compiler versions.
- Added a new benchmark to test the filesystem backend (sector read/write).
  This is a separate benchmark and not in the testsuite.
- Updated newlib patches so as to avoid stdio code fragmenting large
  data blocks passed to fwrite() into smaller chunks if the file is
  unbuffered. This allows to increment filesystem write performance,
  especially FAT32 on SD cards. This change requires recompiling GCC!
- Improved disk.cpp for stm32f4, for improved write performance. This
  allows to fully utilize the multiple sector write, increasing write
  performance when writing large data blocks at a time.
- Started work on integrating Fat32 in the new file abstraction layer.
  Upgraded FatFs from 0.06 to 0.10. Added classes Fat32Fs and Fat32File
- Added an assertion in IntrusiveRefCountedSharedFromThis to help find
  bugs.
- File abstraction layer: FilesystemBase now publicly derives from
  IntrusiveRefCountedSharedFromThis to allow dynamic_casts
- File abstraction layer: added FilesystemBase::getFsId()
- File abstraction layer: added rmdir()
- Implemented the nanosleep() syscall to support sleep() and usleep().
- Removed kernel/unistd.cpp as we're now relying in the implementation of
  sleep() and usleep() in newlib.
- Fixed newlib patch to add HAVE_NANOSLEEP, as it was omitted by mistake.
  This change requires recompiling GCC!
- File abstraction layer: added support for mkdir(), unlink() and rename()
  syscalls.
- File abstraction layer: added testsuite test for directory listing.
  Also removed two tests from the testsuite related to the old Filesystem
  and Directory classes.
- File abstraction layer: implemented fcntl() and getdents().
- File abstraction layer: improved path resolution with support for opening
  directories. Now the substring of the resolved path starting with off
  does not contain a leading /
- Added IntrusiveRefCountedEnableSharedFromThis.
- File abstraction layer: added FilesystemManager::umountAll()
- Fixed support for compiling kernel without WITH_FILESYSTEM and added
  WITH_DEVFS config option to fine-tune code size for a given application.
- File abstraction layer: Finished implementing DevFs with working
  StatelessDeviceFile, and DeviceFileGenerator for stateful files.
  Added MEssageFileGenerator to support /proc/cpuinfo-like stateful
  files.
- File abstraction layer: Moved console support out of DevFs, will allow
  better code size reduction if DevFs is not needed
- File abstraction layer: Addded support for stateless and stateful
  device files, added DeviceFileGenerator to support stateful devices.
- File abstraction layer: TerminalDevice is now instantiated in the FDT
- File abstraction layer: Merged NullFile and NullConsoleDevice classes.
- File abstraction layer: DeviceFile now implements a default version of
  lseek and fstat, to factorize common code from individual device files.
- File abstraction layer: added class DeviceFile from which all files meant
  to be attached to a DevFs should derive. Contains the code to assign an
  unique inode to each of them.
- File abstraction layer: added FilesystemManager::getFilesystemId() to
  have a different st_dev field when stat-ing files from different filesystems.
- File abstraction layer: added stringpart.cpp/.h and devfs/base_files.cpp/.h
  to better modularize code in files. file.h now contains only FileBase and
  FilesystemBase.
- Modified again the newlib patch, to make ino_t an unsigned long, as the
  default was an unsigned short. This change requires recompiling GCC!
- Removed old filesystem mount code in mainLoader(), replaced with
  a call to basicFilesystemSetup() in all BSPs.
- File abstraction layer: added basicFilesystemSetup() to file_access.h
- interfaces/console.h is no longer #included in miosix.h
- Removed the need to call IRQtxComplete() after IRQwrite() in the new
  ConsoleDevice interface, as it simplifies code. Starting getting rid of
  the old console interfaces in many places.
- isatty() and sync() are no longer pure virtual in FileBase, added default
  implementation as in many cases it's enough.
- Removed temporary Console initialization code from _init() and added it
  to individual BSPs. However, we're still using the deprecated Console
  interface and ConsoleAdapter class.
- Joined the InterruptOutputDevice and ConsoleDevice concepts.
  Renamed ConsoleDevice into DefaultConsole, and moved it in a file within
  devfs directory.
- Added code to prevent C++ exceptions from propagating through C syscalls.
- Removed support for old single filesystem support in libc_integration.
- File abstraction layer: Enabled echo by default in TerminalDevice, added
  mutex to serialize reads, and added support for handling the backspace
  character as an usability enhancement.
- File abstraction layer: switched from Mutex to FastMutex for performance.
- Fixed range of printable characters in memDump.
- File abstraction layer now handles stdin/stdout/stderr and passes the
  testsuite, still does not handle fat32 and echo on console is not working.
- File abstraction layer: added MountpointFs as the default root filesystem
  to allow mounting other filesystems.
- Added operator[] to StringPart.
- File abstraction layer: added pure virtual mkdir() to FilesystemBase.
- Renamed DIR struct in FatFs code into _DIR_ to avoid conflicts with
  struct DIR in dirent.h
- File abstraction layer: added ConsoleDevice class to store the default
  console device passed by the board support package.
- File abstraction layer: added ConsoleAdapter class to map the old
  Console class into the new file abstraction. Will be removed when all
  bsp will upgrade to the new model.
- File abstraction layer: correctly handling the one FiledescriptorTable
  model when WITH_PROCESSES is undefined (processes branch not merged yet).
- File abstraction layer: now FileDescriptorTable's constructor opens
  /dev/console as file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 (stdin, stdout and stderr).
- Now all non reentrant syscalls use CReentrancyAccessor::getReent() to set
  the errno variable of the thread they're called in.
- Added option in libc_integration to route the filesystem-related syscalls
  to the old one filesystem model, or the new file abstraction layer allowing
  multiple mountpoint model. The new model will gradually replace the old one. 
- Added -DCOMPILING_MIOSIX to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, to allow the introduction
  of private headers.
- getMaxHeap() in libc_integration.h is now in the miosix namespace
- Changed the boot process. Before _init() created the first thread
  (mainLoader, whose task is to start main()) and then called startKernel().
  Now mainLoader is started directly by startKernel(). Added stage_2_boot.h.
- Added Thread::doCreate() to factorize common code used in Thread::create
  and startKernel(). Takes a bool defaultReent as an addition to let main
  and the idle thread use the global reentrancy structure.
- Added cReent to Thread class.
- Renamed ExceptionHandlingData and ExceptionHandlingAccessor into
  CppReentrancyData and CppReentrancyAccessor for consistency.
- Added classes CReentrancyData and CReentrancyAccessor, to handle newlib
  reentrancy.
- Removed kernel/syscalls.cpp, and moved its content in two files within
  stdlib_integration: libc_integration.h/cpp and libstdcpp_integration.h/cpp
- Added miosix/stdlib_integration directory
- Changed parameter type of memDump() from const char * to const void *
- Improved MemoryProfiling::getCurrentFreeHeap(). It now uses mallinfo()
  instead of returning the high watermark of the heap. Considering that
  malloc returns memory to the OS using sbrk only when there is a block
  of at least 128K, the old implementation could overestimate heap usage by
  as much as 128K. The current implementation is more precise.
- WATERMARK_LEN is now an unsigned int (was an unsigned char)
- Changed return value of Filesystem::fstatFile(). It used to set a st_blksize
  of 0, but now this field is really taken into account for buffer sizing, so
  better use the filesystem block size.
- Added pthread_setcancelstate() stub to pthread.h, as newlib calls it.
- Removed #define WITH_STDIN_BUFFER from miosix_config.h, no longer necessary
  after the new patch.
- Rebuilding the GCC toolchain is required, due to the new newlib patch!
- New newlib patch, with lots of new features, including enabling the
  newlib/libc/posix folder for support to opendir/readdir (optimized),
  size optimized floating point conversion (pushed upstream), shared
  stdin/stdout/stderr across _reent structs, reduced __BUFSIZ__ to 256 byte
  __DYNAMIC_REENT__ to enable __getreent(), removed unused fields from _reent,
  added newlib/libc/sys/miosix, fixed some memory leaks when reclaiming
  a _reent (pushed upstream), reduced page size in malloc to 1KB to better
  utilize RAM in microcontrollers.
- Moved filesystem directory from miosix/kernel/filesystem to miosix/filesystem
- Moved the bootloaders, compiler and testsuite directories inside
  miosix/_tools.
- Reorganized directory structure, all subdirectories of the miosix directory
  that do not contain code that is compiled into the Miosix kernel now start
  with an underscore, to be easily recognizable. These are: the _doc directory
  containing documentation, the _examples directory containing examples, and
  the _tools directory.
- Added first (non working) inplementation of the new file abstraction
  layer.
- Improved pauseKernel() and restartKernel() implementation using atomic
  operations. Tests show a +20% to +40% performance improvement for
  pauseKernel() and restartKernel(), and a +15% performance improvement
  for Mutex operations
- Added tests to testsuite for atomic operations
- Added atomic ops emulation for ARM7 port
- Added an intrusive, lock free, reference counting smart pointer.
  To use it, #include "kernel/intrusive.h". Also added tests to the
  testsuite for intrusive_ref_ptr.
- Added a set of atomic operations too all the cortex ports. These functions
  are available by #including "interfaces/atomic_ops.h"
- Backported implementation of __REV(), __REV16(), __REVSH(), __RBIT(),
  __LDREXB(), __LDREXH(), __LDREXW(), __STREXB(), __STREXH(), __STREXW(),
  from the newer CMSIS to the CMSIS of the stm32f1 and stm32f2 ports.
  This results in a performance increase as those functions are now inline.
  Also, for what concerns the LDREX and STREX family of functions, now the
  pointer parameter is volatile in all ports, which helps writing code
  that calls these functions and works consistently across all ports.
- Changed version number from v1.61 to v20.alpha1 in version.cpp.
- Added -Wno-unused-but-set-variable to Makefile.
- Added testsuite check for global objects support outside of the kernel.
- Removed the use of global objects in the serial port drivers.
- Breaking change regarding constructors of global objects. Up to Miosix v1.61
  they were called during stage_1_boot, therefore before the kernel was
  started. They are now called in stage_2_boot, right before calling main.
  This results in a more intuitive behaviour, as it is now possible to
  write on stdout, access the filesystem, create threads, etc. within
  constructors of global objects. On the downside it is no longer possible to
  instantiate global objects withing the kernel itself, as this would cause
  the risk of accessing objects before their constructor has run. The lack of
  global objects is actively check by check_global_objects.pl at compile time
  to prevent errors.
- Changed stm32vldiscovery default stdio redirection from the DCC to the
  serial port.
- Added stm32f4 sdio driver, tested on stm32f4discovery.
- Improved the SDIO drivers for both stm32f1 and stm32f2. It now uses
  DMA transfers whenever possible. In the stm32f2 it is always possible,
  while in the stm32f1 it is done if the FSMC is not used for data storage.
- Added a test in the testsuite to check writing and reading large files
  from disk, with checksum of the written data.
- Modified the signature of crc16 to accept a void* instead of a char*,
  to avoid casting issues.
- Actually, monitor_soft_reset_halt seems to work in JTAG mode but not with SWD
- Changed references to "monitor soft_reset_halt" into "monitor reset halt"
  as openocd changed in version 0.6.1
- Added scripts to build the new GCC 4.7.2
- Fixed a bug causing a deadlock if a wait on a condition variable is done
  on recursive mutex locked more than once.
- Added test to testsuite to verify the implementation of atomic operations
  as part of the GCC patches.
- Added stack alignment requirement to all arch ports, as different arch
  do have different requirements.
- Modified context switch code for the Cortex-M4 architecture to preserve
  floating point registers. Code use lazy stacking to save fpu registers only
  for threads that do actually use the fpu. Added test to testsuite for this.
- Fixed the CMSIS of all Cortex ports so as to prevent gcc from using the same
  register as the first and second argument of strex, strexh, strexb
- Modified sync.h so as to make mandatory the new gcc 4.7.2 compiler. Not
  that removing the #error in that file would make the kernel compilable
  with the previous compiler anyway, this just produces a meaningful error
  message.
- The build scripts of Miosix used to defile the _MIOSIX macro as a string with
  the name of the board. This has now changed. The _MIOSIX macro is still
  defined but as a compiler intrinsic as part of the gcc patches for 4.7.2.
  As such, it has no string value, and can only be used for #ifdef _MIOSIX or
  other similar constructs. The _MIOSIX_BOARDNAME variable has been added with
  similar semantics as the previous one.
- A change in the board support packages enables the FPU on Cortex-M4
  processors, as gcc 4.7 has support for -mcpu=cortex-m4 
- The kernel now no longer traps unaligned memory accesses when compiled for
  Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4. This has been made necessary as gcc starting from
  4.7 generates unaligned instructions by default. This does not break existing
  code as is only a relaxation of a constraint.
  (https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc-4.7/changes.html)
- Started porting to gcc 4.7.2
v1.61
- Added .gitignore
- Fixed a bug in usleep() occurring when its argument assumes the 1000 value
- Improved Lcd44780 driver
- Improved bitsboard driver
- Added prliminary version of the event API to allow asynchronous programming.
  It is located in the miosix/e20 directory, and provides event loops where
  function calls can be injected by other threads as well as by interrupt
  handlers.
- Modified the implementation of pauseKernel() and restartKernel() so as to
  be able to call them safely within an InterruptDisableLock block. This allows
  allocating memory with malloc/new when interrupts are disabled in an
  InterruptDisableLock (but not in a FastInterruptDisableLock). This change
  only relaxes a constraint, so it does not break existing code.
v1.60
- Added new board: bitsboard. This is effectively an stm32f4discovery tweaked
  be used in the bits project: bits.poul.org
- Fixed a bug in FastMutex::get(): the member function was unimplemented.
- Fixed a bug in ST code for the stm3220g-eval board: despite having a 2MB RAM,
  A18, A19 and A20 were left as GPIOs, resulting in issues when accessing the
  upper part of the RAM.
- Added util/lcd44780.h and util/lcd44780.cpp with support for the common
  HD44780 LCD displays
- Added Gpio::getPin() to convert from a Gpio to a GpioPin class
- Added GpioPin class to make it easier to pass a Gpio as a parameter to a
  function
- Fixed the stm32 SDIO driver to prevent a glitch on the CMD pin from creating
  isues with the card initialization.
- Added EthBoardV2 board to the list of supported boards
- Added configurations support to the Netbeans project. There is now one
  configuration for each supported board. This improves code completion for
  architecture and board specific symbols. Note that selecting a board from the
  IDE does not replace the need to edit miosix/config/Makefile.inc
- Adapted sad_trombone example to also support the stm32f4discovery board
- Added support to stm3220g-eval to miosix/bootloaders/stm32, and renamed
  folder (before it was miosix/bootloaders/stm3210e-eval)
- Added linker scripts that support external ram to stm3220g-eval
- Added external RAM support to stm3220g-eval
- Added make program support to flash the stm3210e-eval using the stm32flash
  utility
- Fixed a bug in the stm3210e-eval related to the xram linker script:
  the stack pointer was set to the external RAM before that ram was enabled
- Fixed a bug in SoftwareSPI::sendRecvChar(), improved overall SoftwareSPI
  code
- Added support for stm32f2 and stm3220g-eval
- Renamed arch/cortexM4_stm32 to arch/cortexM4_stm32f4 for consistency
- Refactored the arch/ directory to avoid code duplication
- Breaking change in the Makefiles
v1.59
- Added arch/cortexM4_stm32 architecture. The current GCC used to build Miosix
  does not yet support the M4 but since the instruction set is backward
  compatible the kernel is currently compiled with -mcpu=cortex-m3. This
  means that floating point operations are still emulated in software, and will
  be fixed when the compiler is upgraded.
- Added a couple of examples, including one using BufferQueue to synchronize
  between a thread and a DMA.
- Added test to testsuite for BufferQueue
- Refactored top level directory, now the testsuite and examples have
  been moved in their directories within the miosix directory
- Improved Queue class
- Added class BufferQueue to simplify the development of double buffered
  data transfers between threads and interrupt routines
- Some const-ness fixes in util
- Extended boot improvements to strive mini board
- Forgot to add util/crc16.cpp to the makefile buid rules
- New target board: Strive. Thanks to Yury Kuchura for contributing the code.
- Improved Thread::join(): when joining a thread, deallocate all its resources
  immeadiately.
- Added tests to testsuite for endianness.h
- Added interfaces/endianness.h with optimized functions to convert to/from
  lille/big endian, as well as byte swapping.
- Improved boot speed by replacing for loops to initialize .data, .bss and
  to initialize the stack of threads with memset/memcpy.
- Improved getMiosixVersion(), new format contains more information, including
  board name, build date and compiler version.
- The files binutils-2.21.tar.bz2 and gdb-7.0.tar.bz2 no longer exist on the
  ftp.gnu.org and mirrors.kernel.org, and this broke the compiler installation
  script. Fixed by downloading binutils-2.21.1 and gdb-7.0.1a.
- Added DCC support for the stm32vldiscovery board, to be able to redirect
  printf through SWD. This has also become the default option for that board.

v1.58
- Added new board stm32vldiscovery
- Fixed a bug in the syscall code to handle static constructors. Despite the
  gcc documentation said that a __guard was 8 bytes, it is actually only 4
- Changing linker scripts to be compatble with the way GCC handles
  .bss with C programs
- Added _times_r in syscalls.cpp to make clock() in time.h work
- Added exception thread safety test to testsuite.
- Added class ExceptionHandlingData that keeps a per-thread data structure
  used to make C++ exceptions thead safe.
- Updated gcc patches, newlib patches and gcc build scripts. Now as far as
  I know, every bit of gcc, newlib and libstdc++ is fully threadsafe, finally!
  (Except the _Reent struct that will be fixed later)
- Fixed a bug in pthread_once(), optimized __cxa_guard_* code.
- Made __register_exitproc() and __call_exitprocs() two new syscalls, to allow
  a future implementation of atexit support.
- Added support for pthread_once, also added new patch to newlib to reduce the
  size of pthread_once_t from 8 bytes to 2 bytes
- Added __cxa_guard_acquire(), __cxa_guard_release() and __cxa_guard_abort()
  to syscalls.cpp. These override the default ones in libstdc++ and provide
  a miosix-aware implementation that can guarantee thread safe initialization
  of static objects. Also, they don't pull in exception support unlike those
  in libstdc++
- Fixed a bug in the control based scheduler that caused sporadic crashes
- Reduced STACK_DEFAULT_FOR_PTHREAD to 2048 bytes, and STACK_MIN to 256 bytes.
- Added tests in testsuite for FastMutex, helped catch one bug
- Refactored code in Mutex and CondotionVariable
- Implement ConditionVariable support for FastMutex
- Breaking change: the Lock and Unlock classes have been templatized to
  work both with Mutex and FastMutex. Existing code Needs to be upgraded
  specifying the template parameter. For example, Lock l(m); becomes
  Lock<Mutex> l(m); or Lock<FastMutex> l(m);
- Added -D_REENT_SMALL flag to CFLAGS_BASE and CXXFLAGS_BASE, otherwise
  #including <reent.h> picks up the wrong version of struct _reent
- Thanks to the patched version of newlib, rewritten pthread mutex and
  condition variable code in a faster way.
- Added new compiler build scripts for gcc-4.5.2, with significantly more
  patching in the newlib area. This is required to implement pthread mutexes
  and condition variables efficiently, as well as to reduce memory footprint.
  As a drawback, the use of the new patched compiler has become mandatory to
  build Miosix.
- Bumped to version 1.58 because from now on the new compiler gcc-4.5.2, and
  especially the new newlib patches become necessary

v1.57
- Added memory barriers to miosix_private::doDisableInterrupts() and
  doEnableInterrupts(), and made fastDisableInterrupts() and
  fastEnableInterrupts() inline, for speed reasons.
- Fixed a bug in Mutex::tryLock(): it would return false in case it was called
  on a recursive mutex locked by the same thread
- Added testsuite tests for new functions/classes
- Added new fastDisableInterrupts(), fastEnableInterrupts() functions and
  FastInterruptDisableLock, FastInterruptEnableLock classes to disable
  interrupts in a fast but not recursive way. Optimized pause and restart
  kernel code, used these new features where appropriate throughout the kernel.
- Fixed a tricky bug in the AuxiliaryTimer implementation for the stm32 arch.
  The prescaler of that timer has a shadow register, and under some timing
  conditions the new prescaler value never made it through the real prescaler,
  resulting in burst values ~700 times less than the value computed by the
  control scheduler. Fixed by forced flush of the prescaler to the shadow
  register.
- Added optional feedforward to control scheduler, defaults to active
  for faster dynamic performance with thread blocking
- Added Scheduler::IRQwaitStatusHook() to inform the scheduler of thread
  blocking
- Added sched_types.h, and separated each *_scheduler.h with an header files
  containing the definition of the SchedData and Priority classes
- Added parameters.h with all control based parameters.

v1.56
- Fixed some bugs in EDF scheduler, found by testsuite.
- Adapted testsuite to work with EDF scheduler.
- Removed configuration option EXIT_ON_HEAP_FULL because since STL containers
  are used in the kernel, there is no more choice: if exceptions are enabled
  on heap full malloc returns NULL and operator new throws bad_alloc, while
  if exceptions are disabled on heap full a reboot is performed, to prevent
  undefined behaviour in STL containers due to operator new not throwing.
- Some code cleanup in the Mutex class.
- Fixed a bug in the priority inheritance mechanism, fixed and added
  a test in the testsuite.
- Removed priority_queue.h and associated test in testsuite.
- Modified Mutex class to use the max heap implementation of the STL.
- Improved preemption points for EDF scheduler.
- Modifed Thread::wakeup(). Now it can no longer be called with the kernel
  paused. Added Thread::PKwakeup() that can be called with the kernel paused.
- Added preemption points in Thread::create(), Thread::setPriority() and
  Thread::wakeup(), active if the EDF scheduler is selected.
- Added file tick_interrupt.h with inline function IRQtickInterrupt() that
  factorizes code for the tick interrupt that was repeated once per target
  architecture.
- Adapted EDF scheduler to use class Priority
- Improved wakeup time in control based scheduler when waking from the idle
  thread.
- Added ControlScheduler::IRQgetIdleThread()
- Changed IRQwakeThreads(). Now it returns a bool.
- Modified control based scheduler for the introduction of the Priority class
- Added Priority class, so that different schedulers can redefine what priority
  means. Changed public interface of Thread class accordingly.
- Started implementing the EDF scheduler, defined three new member functions
  of the Thread class to be able to manage thread deadlines.
- Added Thread::sleepUntil() to make periodic sleeping more accurate.
  Also added a test for it in the testsuite.
- Changed data type for kernel tick from unsigned long long to long long.
  This also required to change the return value of getTick()
- Added files edf_scheduler.h and edf_scheduler.cpp
- Fixed bug in control scheduler: the outer regulator continued increasing
  the burst correction even if the set point could not be attained because of
  saturation of all inner integral regulators. This fix improves regulator
  performance when many threads are blocked.
- Updated openocd config files so that they work with newer releases of
  openocd. Note that this drops compatibility with openocd v0.1.0
- Fixed compiler scripts so that they work on Fedora too.
- Transitioned to git.
- Added the miosix/config/alt-configs directory to store some interesting
  alternative possible configurations.
- Malloc always allocates 4KB sectors that are aligned to 4KB boundaries.
  The linker script on the stm32 architecture has been modified so that the
  main stack (the one used for interrupt handling) is at the beginning of ram
  and not at the end. This will allow malloc to allocate till the ram upper
  limit and not waste the last 4KB block. Unfortunately it's not possible to
  do the same on the lpc2000 because upper 32bytes of ram are used for
  programming the flash memory.
- Changed default value for WITH_STDIN_BUFFER. By default stdin is now buffered.
- As part of a cleanup of linker scripts, some symbols such as _stack_top
  on the stm32 port have been removed.
- Removed filling of stack with a watermark value at boot, on both stm32 and
  lpc2000 architectures, to speed up boot process and for compatibility with
  ongoing linker script optimizations.

v1.55
- Used fixed point arithmethic for internal I regulators instead of simply
  integer arithmethic. This allows the regulator to really reache the set point.
- I+PI scheduler implemented, passes testsuite on both targets.
- Fixed the same bug of AuxiliaryTimer::IRQsetValue(), but in the LPC2000 target
- Fixed AuxiliaryTimer spurious interrupt generation for STM32 if IRQsetValue()
  is called from the SVC interrupt.
- Added ControlScheduler class, started implementing I+PI scheduler.
- Fixed inter dependencies of header files after separation of scheduler from
  kernel
- Added SchedulerData class that collects all data about a thread required by
  a scheduling algorithm. Each Thread instance has a ThreadData instance.
- Thread::getStackBottom() and Thread::getStackSize() are now public,
  so that MemoryProfiling is no longer frien of Thread.
- Added PriorityScheduler class and started moving the hardcoded priority
  scheduler from the kernel to this class.
- Added scheduler.h as an interface to separate the scheduler from the kernel.
- Refactored portableStartKernel to IRQportableStartKernel, since was called
  with interrupts disabled.
- Added miosix/libmiosix.a as dependency of main.elf in the Makefile,
  otherwise changing someting in the kernel required a make clean; make
- Added AuxiliaryTimer class to portability.h, to implement the control based
  scheduler.
- Code refactoring to replace names with function and method names with
  underscores with names in camelcase. Not very useful but improves code
  consistency.

v1.54
- Now sector read and write in the stm32 port retry up to three times before
  giving up, to increase robustness and to fix a bug with large size uSD cards.
- Modified config/Makefile.inc to use the arm-miosix-eabi compiler
- Added compiler scripts to build gcc tailored to miosix
- Changed interface of Thread::detach() and Thread::join(). Now they take
  the thread to detach/join as "this" parameter, for consistency.
- Added -D_POSIX_THREADS to Makefile.inc, so that pthreads.h is available
  in the C standard library.
- Added file miosix/kernel/pthread.cpp
- Added Mutex::PKisLocked() to implement pthread_mutex_destroy()
- Now some pthread functions are friend of Mutex and ConditionVariable, to use
  the PK* private member functions.
- Added ConditionVariable::PKwait() and ConditionVariable::PKisEmpty()
  to implement pthread condition variables.
- Fixed a bug in Thread::isDetached(): it returned the detach status of the
  current thread instead of the status of the thread on which the member
  function was called.
- Added tests to testsuite to check the pthread implementation.

v1.53
- Repleced some more calls to disable_interrupts()/enable_interrupts() and
  pause_kernel()/restart_kernel() with the safer InterruptDisableLock and
  PauseKernelLock.
- Generated doxygen documentation, and fixed some bugs about doxygen tags
  in source files.
- Improved Thread class. Now its constructor and destructor are called
  using the placement new syntax. Before, the class was used even if its
  constructor was never called.
- Implemented Console::write as a call to serial_write instead of
  serial_write_str to reduce the function call depth when printing to the
  console, since it caused stack overflows if printing from threads whose
  stack is STACK_MIN and the code is compiled with -O0 which does not perform
  stack frame optimizations
- Removed serial_write_str as it is no longer used
- Added CTXSAVE_ON_STACK constant to arch_settings.h to take into account
  that some architectures save part of the cotext on the stack.
- Upgraded Thread::create, start_kernel and MemoryProfiling to take int account
  CTXSAVE_ON_STACK
- Added ThreadFlags inner class of Thread to handle thread flags at a higher
  level.
- Added an overload of Thread::create that accepts an entry point function
  that returns a void *, for compatibility with pthreads.
- Added another default parameter to Thread::create, options to set additional
  thread options, such as joinable threads.
- Added Thread::IRQexists(), necessary to implement joinable threads.
- Added DETACHED and WAIT_JOIN flags to ThreadFlags class, and required setter/
  getter.
- Added Thread::detach(), Thread::isDetached() and Thread::join() to add
  support for joinable threads.
- Added test to testsuite for joinable threads.
- Added private constructor and operator= to InterruptDisableLock,
  InterruptEnableLock, PauseKernelLock and RestartKernelLock.
- Added Unlock class to temporarily unlock a Mutex.
- Added kernel/unistd.cpp and implemented sleep() and usleep()
- Moved struct LockedData as a private inner struct of Mutex.
- A bit of refactoring, added delays.h and gpio.h in miosix/interfaces, and
  also added the arch_registers.h interface.
- Added portability.h and bsp.h to interfaces. Now code is more consistent,
  since all calls from kernel code to architecture specific code is done
  through the headers in the interfaces folder.
- Changed name of miosix_private::system_reboot to
  miosix_private::IRQsystem_reboot
- Added ConditionVariable class.
- Added private member functions PKlock() and PKunlock() to Mutex, to allow to
  lock and unlock mutexes with kernel paused, which is necessary to atomically
  unlock the mutex and wait in condition variables.
- Added tests to testsuite for ConditionVariable.
- Increased default value for WATERMARK_LEN from 4 to 16, to help catch
  stack overflows.
- Recently there were a bit too many stack overflows in thread whose stack size
  is STACK_MIN, so STACK_MIN was increased from 256 to 384 bytes.
- Added new Mutex implementation. This one fixes several issues with the
  prevoius implementation regarding priority inheritance, for example this
  new mplementation allows to lock mre mutexes at the same time ans still
  have priority inheritance working, or to change the thread's priority while
  locking a mutex still with no issues.
- Changed signature of Thread::set_priority(). It is now static and therefore
  it is no longer allowed for a thread to change thie priority of another
  thread. This proved of little use, and this change allowed to implement the
  full priority inheritance algorithm.
- Added test to testsuite to check the new priority inheritance algorithm.
- Added Mutex::PKtryLock to prepare for pthreads
- Added Lock::get() and Unlock::get() and removed friends of Lock.
- Fixed doxygen documentation. Excluded arch/ folder because doxygen doesn't
  like the same functions being declared two times in the two architectures.
- Fixed a bug in error_handler since it disabled interrupts even if called
  within an interrupt routine.

v1.52
- added ARM.extab* and ensured 8 byte alignment to linker scripts, as required
  by eabi.
- Added back the check to see if the stack pointer is within bounds at every
  context switch.
- Enabled traps for unaligned memory access and division by zero in the cortex
  m3 port.
- Added a #define to each arch and each board to allow querying this data in
  code with an #ifdef
- Removed Thread::do_terminate(), it was already deprecated in Miosix 1.0x due
  to risk of memory leaks.
- Added Thread::threadLauncher() and modified init_ctxsave() accordingly.
  This new way of spawning threads allows to catch unhandled exceptions
  that propagate through their entry point. Now they are caught in
  threadLauncher() and this avoids undefined behaviour.
- Updated testuite so that it does not use Thread::do_terminate()
- Added test to testsuite to check the correctness of the argv parameter
- Added test to testsuite to check exception propagation through entry point
- Improved debug information for arm7. Now data abort and prefetch abort
  are handled separately from undefined instruction. This makes error
  identification easier and the error address is now precise.
- Added MemoryProfiling class to util to gather detailed memory statistics.
- Make Thread::get_stack_bottom() private because MemoryProfiling is now friend
  of Thread.
- Added test to testsuite for MemoryProfiling
- Optmized system stacks in arm7_lpc2000 port now undef, data abort and prefetch
  abort share the same stack, and irq and svc share the same stack.
- Added prliminary implementation of PriorityQueue
- Added test to testsuite for PriorityQueue
- Optimized PriorityQueue for code size. Looks like recursive inline destructors
  cause much code duplication.
- Now SVC and SysTick interrupts on Cortex M3 have a priority of 3, instead
  of the default value 0.
- Rewritten serial driver. Now serial rx is interrupt based instead of polled,
  while serial tx uses DMA if possible.
- Fixed a bug in the serial driver of the arm7 port where calling
  IRQserial_disable() while a thread was sending data could result in that
  thread blocking.
- Started implementation of SDIO driver for stm32
- Fatorized filesystem mount from bsp_init2() to _main_loader() since it
  must be the same for all architetures
- Fixed a bug in Filesystem::Filesystem which caused fs initialization to
  happen twice. Now the constructor does no longer try to mount the filesystem.
- Inlined Disk::isInitialzed() and Filesystem::isMounted() because it was
  noticed that these functions are called many times during filesystem access.
- Increased stack sizes of threads spawned during filesystem test, from 1.5KB
  to 2.5KB, because they caused stack overflow.
- Added InterruptEnableLock and RestartKernelLock for an additional degree
  of freedom when there is the need to disable interrupts and/or pause the
  kernel.
- Completed SDIO driver for stm32. It implements the Disk interface and allows
  read/write access to an SD card using the hardware peripheral available in
  the stm32.
- Cleaned up the temp directory
- Added readme for stm32 bootloader.
- Renamed this branch from miosix_np_unstable to miosix_np_2 as code is now
  stable in both architectures for quite a while
- Added test to testsuite for checking if stderr works

v1.51
- Implemented interfaces/disk.h which is the interface between the kernel
  part of the filesystem code and the architecture dependent part.
- Changed MAX_OPEN_FILES to 8, since memory for files is dynamically allocated
- Started porting to stm32, modified Makefile.inc
- Porting to stm32, added CMSIS directory
- Porting to stm32, implemented portability.h and portability.cpp
- Porting to stm32, added stage_1_boot and stage_2_boot
- Porting to stm32, new bsp.cpp with only basic functionality
- Porting to stm32, basic polled serial driver in serial.cpp
- Porting to stm32, implemented Console interface using serial driver
- Porting to stm32, added microcontroller_registers.h as interface so that
  miosix.h is independent on the microcontroller type
- Added gpio.h as an architecture-independent way to access gpios
- Added delays.h and delays.cpp to have busy-waiting delays for milliseconds
  and microseconds.
- Added __DSB to interrupt handler where preemption is possible to preserve
  memory consistency
- Added __DMB to eneble_interrupts() and restore_interrupts() to preserve
  memory consistency
- Added printout of unexpected exceptions and the program conuter value when
  the hardware exception happened
- Added additional debug information to unexpected exception handlers, taken
  from Cortex M3 system control block.
- Found how to enable fault handlers, before all fault handlers escalated to
  hardfault.
- Now disable_interrupts() and enable_interrupts() calls can be nested.
- Removed disable_and_save_interrupts() and restore_interrupts() since they
  have been superseded by disable_interrupts() and enable_interrupts()
- Added two new possible errors to the Error enum, PAUSE_KERNEL_NESTING, and 
  DISABLE_INTERRUPTS_NESTING.
- Moved the error_handler() in its own file kernel/error.cpp
- Added RAII class DisableInterruptLock
- Added RAII class PauseKernelLock
- Fctorized stage_2_boot in miosix/kernel. Since the boot process is the same
  for all architectures there is no need to replicate code in arch
- Fixed a bug in Cortex M3 where interrupts were enabled at boot, and added
  a runtime check to make sure it does not happen again.
- Fixed a bug in the testsuite in benchmark_2 where a preemption happening
  in between two function calls would cause deadlock.
- Fixed a bug in the Console implementation for Cortex M3 (serial_read_char())
  where a mutex was not unlocked and caused locking the same mutex multiple
  times. The fix implied using the Lock class instead using lock()/unlock()
- The above bug in Console allowed to discover a long standing bug in the Mutex
  implememtation where locking the same mutex twice did not cause a deadlock,
  and locking the same mutex three times caused memory corruption.
- Added a new possible error to the Error enum, DEADLOCK which fixes the bug
  above.
- Fixed some bugs in the testsuite. For short, if a preemption occurred in some
  places some of the tests would fail. This happened also before, but the
  increased tick frequency of the Cortex port (1000Hz) together with the running
  from RAM (slow nomber of instructions per second) made this more evident.
- Removed __DSB and __DMB from interrupt handlers and disable_interrupts() since
  they are not necessary.
- Factorized disable_interrupts() and enable_interrupts() and
  are_interrupts_enabled() in kernel.h, the nesting counter is implemented only
  one time, and added doDisableInterrupts(), doEnableInterrupts() and
  checkAreInterruptsEnabled() to portability.h to access the hardware.
  Also now disable_interrupts() and enable_interrupts() return immediately
  before the kernel is started. Lastly, if the nesting reaches the limit
  error_handler(NESTING_OVERFLOW) is called.
- Added doYield() to portability.h as a proper solution to the arch-dependant
  implementation of Thread::yield().
- Cleaned up some code using DisableInterruptsLock and PauseKernelLock.
- Testsuite is now running continuously for more than an hour on both
  architectures and no fault occurred.

v1.50
- Bumped version to 1.50. This is the unstable version. After all changes will
  be done the version will be bumped again to 2.00.
- Removed notice saying this changelog was only for the kernel. There is no
  longer separation from kernel and drivers for quite some time.
- Changed directory structure to the new one to allow multiple archithectures
  and schedulers.
- Changed makefiles. The new ones do not contain architecture dependent details
  except for Makefile.inc where it is possible to select the target architecture
  and board.
- Added files util/version.h and util/version.cpp. They contain a function
  to get the kernel version string.
- Modified syscalls.cpp, added __cxa_pure_virtual in case exceptions are
  disabled, and added #ifdef EXIT_ON_HEAP_FULL to select behaviour on heap
  overflow.
- Removed WITH_NONSTANDARD_ALLOC option in kernel_settings.h, it was broken and
  useless.
- Removed WITH_TICK_HOOK option in kernel_settings.h.
- Removed WITH_CPU_METER option in kernel_settings.h since cpu load monitor
  won't work with some scheduling algorithm.
- Removed kernel_settings.h and merged its content in miosix_settings.h
- Removed WITH_INIT_CALLBACKS option in kernel_settings.h. Initialization is
  now done in the bsp or in main().
- Removed WITH_ERROR_HANDLER option from kernel_settings.h since it wasn't
  really supported.
- Added -D_MIOSIX to the makefiles (and removed it from miosix.h) so that user
  code can do a #ifdef _MIOSIX to see if the OS is Miosix.
- Split configuration options in three file: config/miosix_settings.h for the
  architecture independent options, arch/<arch name>/common/arch_settings.h
  for options that depend on the architecture, and
  arch/<arch name>/<board name>/board_settings.h for options that depend on the
  board.
- Added Console interface to decouple the kernel from its underlying
  implementation.
- Added file kernel/logging.h with inline functions to print boot logs and
  error logs only if they are enabled in config/miosix_settings.h
- Added Filesystem class which wraps filesystem access. It is supposed to be
  an interface between the C/C++ standrd library's syscalls and the FatFs
  library.
- Removed fs_mutex, mount_filesystem(), umount_filesystem() and
  is_filesystem_mounted(). These functions are now in the Filesystem class.
- Implemented _kill() syscall. Since in Miosix there is only one process
  calling it causes a reboot.
- Added new option to miosix_settings.h: SYNC_AFTER_WRITE to let the user choose
  safe or fast filesystem write access.

v1.03
- Added #ifdef __NO_EXCEPTIONS around operator new/delete in syscalls.cpp, and
  added -D__NO_EXCEPTIONS in Makefile.inc. In this way if compiling with
  exception support operator new/delete are not redefined and throw
  std::bad_alloc as expected.
- Added -ffunction-sections to Makefile.inc to optimize code size

v1.02
- Centralized compiling options in Makefile.inc. This makes easy changing
  optimization flags, and switchin between arm-elf-gcc and arm-none-eabi-gcc
- Fixed C++ code in naked functions bug that prevented the kernel from being
  compiled with CodeSorcery
- Added -Wl,--start-group and -Wl,--end-group around system libraries in the
  Makefile, to fix a problem with Codesourcery GCC
- Redefined __verbose_terminate_handler to reduce code size and avoid some
  problems with uncaught exceptions
- Updated linker script and startup assembler file.
- Added Lock class in sync.h to allow locking a mutex in an exception safe way
- Added JTAG_DISABLE_SLEEP #define to allow disbling sleep mode in idle thread
  otherwise JTAG debuggers lose communication with the device.
- Method do_terminate() in the Thread class is now deprecated because it can
  cause memory leaks.

v1.01
- Added _getpid_r and _kill_r functions to syscalls.cpp because they seem
  required when compiling with GNUARM compiler on windows.
- Added bug report on Thread::set_priority() to documentation.
- Exception support is now enabled by default

v1.00
- This will be the first public release, so that's why the version number jumped
  from v0.34 to v1.00. Doing a lot of refactoring to make code easier to read.
- Changed implementation of Thread::terminate(), now it disables interrupts
  instead of pausing the kernel to avoid race condition in a read-modify-write
  operation.
- In Thread::create() stacksize must be divisible by 4. Added a comment and a
  check in the code that rounds the number if it is not divisible by 4.
- Thread::wait() and Thread::IRQwait() are now static, so that a thread cannot
  put another thread in wait status.
- Refactoring: merged RTOS and miosix namespaces. New name is miosix.
  Renamed namespace RTOS_portable. New name is miosix_private.
  Renamed RTOS_IRQ_Routine() and RTOS_SWI_routine(). New name is kernel_...
  "RTOS" folder renamed to "kernel", rtos.cpp and rtos.h rtos_settings.h
  renamed kernel.cpp, kernel.h and kernel_settings.h
- Added default parameters to Thread::create() now default priority is 1 and
  default argv is NULL
- Refactoring: renamed Process class, new name is Thread. Also renamed methods,
  variables containig the word "process" examples are:
  IRQfind_next_process() > IRQfind_next_thread() process_list > thread_list...
- Added method try_lock() to class Mutex
- Refactoring: renamed method Mutex::enter() to Mutex::lock() and Mutex::leave()
  to Mutex::unlock() for more consistency with other threading libraries (boost)
- The kernel tick is now an unsigned long long (64bit integer), while before it
  was a 32bit integer. This allows not worryinng about tick overflow.
  the function get_tick() was therefore changed to return an unsigned long long.
- The list of sleeping threads is now sorted so that there is no need to scan
  it all at every tick to improve performance.
- Modified makefile, it no longer makes libmiosix_rtos.a, since was useless in
  most cases. The part of makefile that created it are simply commented out.
- Added IRQreset() method to Queue class, to allow resetting a queue from inside
  interrupts.
- Removed serial_init() and serial_disable() from Serial.cpp, and added
  IRQserial_init() and IRQserial_disable(). Now serial port needs interrupts
  disabled to be turned on/off.

v0.34
- Added disable_and_save_interrupts() and restore_interrupts() in portability.h
  to allow writing code that need interrupts disabled to work both when
  interrupts are already disabled and when interrupts are enabled.
- Modified pause_kernel() and restart_kernel(). These functions now disable
  interrupts (with disable_and_save_interrupts()) before incrementing/
  decrementing kernel_running variable, because increment may not be an atomic
  operation and may cause race condition.
- kernel_running is now no longer declared volatile, since it is only modified
  when interrupts are disabled.
- Added information about the maximum sleep time as a comment to Process::sleep
- Added is_kernel_running() in rtos.cpp
- Added are_interrupts_enabled() in portability.cpp

v0.33
- Now priority is always represented by a "short int" instead of an
  "unsigned char". This is because the idle process' priority is -1. This
  standardized priority system fixes a bug in Queue::IRQget(T, bool&) and
  Queue::IRQput(T, bool&) to allow implementing context switch inside a driver
  interrupt.
- system_reboot() in namespace RTOS_portable is now extern "C" to allow using
  it inside IRQ easily
- Added PCONP explicit peripheral enable in Portability.cpp, Serial.cpp and
  filesystem driver, to allow ondemand peripheral enable strategy.
- Added get_stack_bottom() to process class.

v0.32
- Fixed a possible cause of deadlock in Mutex::enter()
- Fixed bug in Process::sleep(). Now if the kernel tick overflows, it
  causes no problems.
- get_tick() moved out of class Process. It is now a function and not a method,
  since it was unrelated with Process class.
- Wow, no more FIXME in the kernel code ;)

v0.31
- Added again atomic_swap(), because it can be used for some device driver.
- Added Process::get_tick() to allow implementation of timer class.
- Added Timer class, to measure time intervals.
- Changed IRQfind_next_process from
  if(process_list[i]==NULL) continue;
  temp=process_list[i];
  for(;;)
  [...]
  process_list[i]=temp->next;
  [...]
  if(temp==process_list[i]) break;
  to
  if(process_list[i]==NULL) continue;
  temp=process_list[i]->next;
  for(;;)
  [...]
  process_list[i]=temp;
  [...]
  if(temp==process_list[i]->next) break;
  to fix an undesired behaviour of Process::yield() (discovered in testsuite)
- Added error_handler(UNEXPECTED); after Process::yield(); in
  Process::do_terminate.
- Added volatile to kernel_running because pause_kernel and restart_kernel can
  be called from different processes
- In Queue class, added IRQwake_waiting_process() at the end of the while in
  put(), get(), wait_until_not_full(), wait_until not_empty() methods to fix a
  cause of deadlock (discovered in test_8 of testsuite)
- Added some compiler flag to RTOS makefile to improve performance
- Testsuite now ready

v0.30
- Modified interface and implementation of Queue class
- Removed RTOS::Process::kill() and RTOS::remove_from_sleeping_list, since
  those functions can cause system crash
- Removed SleepLock and Mutex classes, and renamed PhMutex class in Mutex class.
  Reason: no time to test all those classes, better concentrate on ONE Mutex
  class and try to test it to avoid bugs.
- Added a check in Process::sleep() since if the sleep time was lower than the
  tick resolution, that might cause deadlock. Now the behaviour in this
  condition is defined, and written as a comment to the Process::sleep method.
- Added two more methods to the Queue class, wait_until_queue_not_full() and
  wait_until_queue_not_empty() to allow implementing device drivers where
  interaction between a software and an hardware queue is required.
- Reorganized code in portability.h and portability.cpp. Now some functions
  and macros are no longer "private". This will allow context switch inside
  interrupt based device drivers.
- Fixed bug in cpu meter when using IRQ based device drivers
- Reorganized code in rtos.h and rtos.cpp. Now functions that must be called
  inside an IRQ, even if "private" are prefixed with IRQ, and
  IRQfind_next_process() is now "public" (declared in rtos.h) to allow context
  switch inside interrupt based device drivers.
- Removed atomic_swap from portability.h and portability.cpp because useless.
- Temporarily fixed pointer aliasing problem.
- Added Process::exists in Process class, to see if a process is running or
  has been deleted.

No changelog was kept prior to v0.30.
