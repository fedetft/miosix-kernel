Rationale for gcc patch
-----------------------

This patch does the following:

1) It modifies the config/gthr.m4 and libgcc/configure files to add
   gthr-miosix.h to the build system.

2) It modifies gcc/config.gcc to add the miosix-eabi.h file and t-arm-miosix to
   the build system.

3) It modifies gcc/configure and gcc/configure.ac to accept the parameter
   --enable-threads=miosix

4) It adds gcc/config/arm/miosix-eabi.h which defines the builtin _MIOSIX and
   the miosix patch version.

5) It adds gcc/config/arm/t-arm-miosix to enable multilibs for the thumb2
   instruction set which are disabled by default. This is required to build
   code for Cortex M0/M3/M4/M7. It also enables fpie/msingle-pic-base multilibs
   where applicable to implement processes.

6) Given that Miosix does not have a thread local storage API, but it is
   required in a couple of places related to C++ exception handling
   (that is, gcc/unwind-sjlj.c and libsupc++/eh_globals.cc), those files have
   been modified removing functions to get/set the thread-local variables.
   Those functions are now implemented within Miosix, in kernel/syscalls.cpp

7) It adds the gcc/gthr-miosix.h specifying the miosix thread model, basically
   telling the compiler that threadsafe code is required and pointing it to
   the routines it needs to do so (standard posix routines). Without this
   modification, arm-miosix-eabi-gcc -v would report "Thread model: single"
   and generate thread unsafe code.

8) The thread safe initialization of C++ static objects can be implemented
   more efficiently using the Miosix API rather than the POSIX one, so the
   functions __cxa_guard_[acquire|release|abort] have been removed from
   libsupc++/guard.cc and implemented in miosix/kernel/syscalls.cpp

9) It reduces the size of the emergency buffer in
   libstdc++-v3/libsupc++/eh_alloc.cc, which is used for allocating the
   std::bad_alloc exception that operator new should throw when the heap is
   full. By default it is set to a conservative value that is too large when
   compared with the RAM size of microcontrollers.

10) It makes the verbose terminate handler a weak synbos to save code size.

11) It adds __attribute__((weak)) to some functions that pull in exception
   support to make them overridable by miosix when compiling without exceptions
   to minimize code size. The only ones which are not made weak are:
   - ios_failure: already large code size, so might as well not disable exceptions
   - regex: same as above
   - occurrences of _GLIBCXX_THROW_OR_ABORT in headers. Don't know how to fix
     those, if they are ever used inside a .cc file within libstdc++ itself.

NOTES

Types to watch out
------------------
Some unexported types are copy-pasted in the kernel, and need to be kept consistent
struct __cxa_eh_globals in miosix/stdlib_integration/libstdcpp_integration.h


Calculations to minimize the emergency buffer for throwing std::bad_alloc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sample program to do the computation -- begin
//Requires to copy-paste unwind-cxx.h from libsupc++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unwind.h>
#include "unwind-cxx.h"
#include <stdexcept>
int main()
{
    printf("sizeof(_Unwind_Exception) %d\n",sizeof(_Unwind_Exception));
    printf("sizeof(_Atomic_word) %d\n",sizeof(_Atomic_word));
    printf("sizeof(__cxa_exception) %d\n",sizeof(__cxxabiv1::__cxa_exception));
    printf("sizeof(__cxa_refcounted_exception) %d\n",sizeof(__cxxabiv1::__cxa_refcounted_exception));
    printf("sizeof(std::bad_alloc) %d\n",sizeof(std::bad_alloc));
    printf("sizeof(std::logic_error) %d\n",sizeof(std::logic_error));
    throw std::bad_alloc();
}
# Sample program to do the computation -- end

unwind-cxx.h declares __cxa_refcounted_exception, while unwind-arm-common.h
declares _Unwind_Exception. Size computations as of Sep 1, 2019.

The size of __cxa_refcounted_exception on ARM is:
sizeof(_Unwind_Exception) 88
sizeof(_Atomic_word) 4
sizeof(__cxa_exception) 120
sizeof(__cxa_refcounted_exception) 128
sizeof(std::bad_alloc) 4
sizeof(std::logic_error) 8

While on other archs is (commenting #ifdef __ARM_EABI_UNWINDER__ part in unwind-cxx.h)
sizeof(_Unwind_Exception) 88
sizeof(_Atomic_word) 4
sizeof(__cxa_exception) 136
sizeof(__cxa_refcounted_exception) 144
sizeof(std::bad_alloc) 4
sizeof(std::logic_error) 8

Thus allocating bad_alloc takes 132Bytes on ARM, and 148Bytes on other archs.

It is recomended to leave some space just in case a different exception is
thrown, like logic_error or runtime_error and there is no heap to allocate it.
By seeing stdecept and stdexcept.cc these classes only contain a string object,
and sizeof(logic_error) returns 8 bytes (4=vptr 4=string).

Note Jul 5, 2010.
A testcase started to fail, JTAG debugging found that a bad_alloc was allocated
that required 132Bytes. Expanding EMERGENCY_OBJ_SIZE to 160 bytes (128+32) to leave
some margin.
Note Sep 1, 2019.
Apparently, nothing changed in 9 years, as bad_alloc still requires 132Bytes.

Conclusion:
Looks like EMERGENCY_OBJ_SIZE can be shrinked from 512 to 160bytes, for 32bit systems.
For EMRGENCY_OBJ_COUNT, 3 is good.
